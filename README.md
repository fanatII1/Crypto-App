The following web app is used to display live cryptocurrency prices using the
[https://www.coingecko.com/en/api/documentation](CoinGecko API) .

The application should consist of at least two pages:

This is the landing/home page. Here, the you should see a list of the top 10 cryptocurrencies. Ie. the 10 cryptocurrencies
with the largest market cap value. List is arranged from highest to lowest market cap.

The list also shows some additional information about the cryptocurrency. At the minimum the current price of the cryptocurrency 

## Cryptocurrency Details Page
When you click on a cryptocurrency in the list on the home page, the you'll be redirected to the cryptocurrency

* simple list of items showing the price, market cap, total supply, market rank. 
* You have the ability to select compared currency (eg. Coin price in ZAR, USD, BTC, etc.)
* Also showing the speicific chart related to a specific crypto

## Build technologies

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
